### About Day One

We discussed two main Node.js core modules: the file system (fs) and the http module. We use the file system to interact with files and directories in our project while the http module is used in the creation of servers in Node.js.

We also discussed streams, i.e. read and write streams, as well piping between these streams. Finally, we set up a simple server logging important information about our request to the console.
